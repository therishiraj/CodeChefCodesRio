This was the question:
There are N horses in the stable. The skill of the horse i is represented by an integer S[i]. 
The Chef needs to pick 2 horses for the race such that the difference in their skills is minimum. 
This way, he would be able to host a very interesting race. Y
our task is to help him do this and report the minimum difference that is possible between 2 horses in the race.


And this is my answer in C++:

#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;

        int S[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cin >> S[i];
        }

        // Sort the skills of horses in ascending order
        sort(S, S + n);

        // Find the minimum difference between two horses
        int minDifference = S[1] - S[0];
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            int difference = S[i] - S[i - 1];
            if (difference < minDifference) {
                minDifference = difference;
            }
        }

        cout << minDifference << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
